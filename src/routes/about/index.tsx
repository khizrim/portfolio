        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          I'm a frontend developer with a deep passion for typography and a
          strong focus on pixel-perfect design. Proficient in TypeScript and
          React, I also have a background in team management and interface
          design. My previous role as a design team lead has given me a unique
          perspective, allowing me to craft beautiful and user-friendly
          interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thrive on the challenge of solving technical problems
          and take great satisfaction in creating efficient and elegant code. I
          love being part of this dynamic field and am excited about my ongoing
          growth as a developer. ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€
